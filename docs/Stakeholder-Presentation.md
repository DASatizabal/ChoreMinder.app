## 🎯 Slide 2: The Problem We Solve

### **The Household Management Crisis**

#### **By the Numbers:**
- **78%** of parents report daily stress about getting kids to help with chores
- **7+ hours/week** spent on household coordination tasks
- **65%** of children don't have regular chore responsibilities
- **$12 billion** household management market growing at 15% annually

#### **Real Family Pain Points:**
- "I spend more time nagging than if I just did it myself"
- "My kids forget their responsibilities constantly"
- "We tried chore charts, but they never stick"
- "I have no idea if chores are actually being done well"

#### **Current Solutions Fall Short:**
- **Too Simple**: Basic chore charts lack engagement
- **Too Complex**: Enterprise tools aren't family-friendly
- **No Integration**: Separate apps for communication, scheduling, rewards
- **Adult-Focused**: Built for productivity, not child development
